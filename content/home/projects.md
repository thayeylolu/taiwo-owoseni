### Statisitcs : A/B Testing
-I ran a case study where A/B testing is applied to the ad click through rate. The data soucre can be found in [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/osuolaleemmanuel/ad-ab-testing). The primary aim is to compare user interactions with the bio questionnaire to determine which interaction statistically improves CTR.

### Data Visualization : Netflix Dashboard

- I worked in a team of four to build a [data visualization dashboard](https://dsci-532-netflixpy.herokuapp.com/). It allows our target audience to visually and interactively explore a database of movies and TV shows to assess the popular content they need to provide to their viewers. This app provides easy access to information related to types of movies and TV shows available on Netflix. This information could be useful to companies providing online streaming services for creating and designing their content catalog.

### Machine Learning : Feature Analysis

- I interpreted and analysed the importance of features of the [pumpkin seed data set](https://www.kaggle.com/mkoklu42/pumpkin-seeds-dataset?select=Pumpkin_Seeds_Dataset.xlsx) across three machine learning algorithms: Logistic Regression,
Random Forest and Light Gradient Boost. [Analysis here] (https://github.com/thayeylolu/Feature-Analysis/blob/main/feature%20analysis.ipynb)
