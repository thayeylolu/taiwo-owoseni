### Cyberbullying Detection in Tweets 
**Tools**:  Python, NLTK, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, Github, Git, Pytorch, Hugging Face Transformer

Automated process to determine Cyberbullying . In this [project](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/vector-institute_cyberbullying-ml-dl-activity-7034945655965945856-S3VY?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop), I built a classifier using PyTorch to fine-tune a BERT model. 

### Feature Analysis

I interpreted and analysed the importance of features of the [pumpkin seed data set](https://www.kaggle.com/mkoklu42/pumpkin-seeds-dataset?select=Pumpkin_Seeds_Dataset.xlsx) across three machine learning algorithms: Logistic Regression,
Random Forest and Light Gradient Boost. [Analysis here](https://github.com/thayeylolu/Feature-Analysis/blob/main/feature%20analysis.ipynb)

### A/B Testing

I ran a case study where A/B testing is applied to the ad click through rate. The data soucre can be found in [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/osuolaleemmanuel/ad-ab-testing). The primary aim is to compare user interactions with the bio questionnaire to determine which interaction statistically improves CTR.
