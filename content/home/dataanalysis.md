### Data Visualization : Fraud Purchase Analysis Dashboard
**Tools** Excel, Tableau
I created a [Tableau dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/taiwo.owoseni2578/viz/start2_16777138500650/Dashboard1) to provide comprehensive view of fraudulent activity in the US, using data-driven analysis techniques to uncover important trends and patterns. The dashboard includes charts that display fraudulent purchase activities across different US states, a time series of purchase activities using a six-week moving window, and comparisons of fraud frequency between different employment statuses and fitlers by genders.

### Data Visualization : Netflix Dashboard
**Tools** Dash, Python, Altair, Pandas, CSS, HTML
I worked in a team of four to build a [data visualization dashboard](https://dsci-532-netflixpy.herokuapp.com/). It allows target audience to visually and interactively explore a database of movies and TV shows, to assess the popular content they need to provide to their viewers. This app provides easy access to information related to types of movies and TV shows available on Netflix. This information could be useful to companies providing online streaming services for creating and designing their content catalog.
