### Feature Analysis
_Using ELI5 to interpret the features of a data set via the weights of boosting algorithms and a random forest alogrithm_

- I created [Indoor Scene Detector](https://github.com/nicovandenhooff/indoor-scene-detector) with my classmate Melissa Liow.  Indoor Scene Detector is a full stack computer vision application built with PyTorch, Captum, Flask, React, Docker, Heroku and GitHub Pages.  It is capable of classifying images of an indoor scene, such as a bedroom or a kitchen.  You can use one of four convolutional neural networks to classify the image within the application.
- I participated in the [WiDS Datathon 2022 Kaggle Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/widsdatathon2022) as a team with three of my classmates from UBC.  The goal of the project was to use weather data, climate data, and building characteristics to build a Machine Learning model to accurately predict a building's energy consumption.  Our [final solution](https://www.kaggle.com/nicojv/wids-datathon-2022-ensemble-learning-top-10) implemented an ensemble of gradient boosted models, and ended up in the top 10% of all solutions on Kaggle.
